                                    The Rajapaksa Regime especially President Rajapaksa is now electorally vulnerable. We challenge the Regime to hold the election as planned and face the truth about the chaos and misery that the Rajapaksa rule has brought upon the people, the UNP says. The revolutionary milestone where it yearning for freedom and justice, and the march towards the ultimate defeat of the Rajapakse regime has begun in Uva Province.

                                    Sri Lanka's tender procedure for the procurement of coal to operate the Norochcholai power plant has taken a dubious turn with the cancellation of bids for the second time in eight months.

                                    Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL), regulatory body, is awaiting Finance Ministry recommendations on how to make up for the annual revenue shortfall of around Rs. 60 billion following the govt's decision to reduce the monthly electricity bill of consumers by 25%. Power and Energy Ministry is yet to submit its proposals to the Treasury, which in turn would recommend the policy decision to PUCSL for implementation.
